# Welcome to a New Age

In a state of regrowth, the world is blossoming with unexplored lands and terrifying secrets. Humanity has begun to reshape the land into something familiar to them. Cities and tribes all forming and creating places for them to live, eat, and survive. Survival however is not certain, the ancient ones greatest sin makes sure of that. The world is plagued by monsters. Beings whose very existence defies all logic and reason. Because of this, humanity lives in fear. Humanity huddles in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that they don't understand. It is more than explaining why the sun came up, it is the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men and rocks that came to life. Despite the fear and constant tragedy, humanity has hope. They all remember the ancient ones.

The ancient ones not only dealt with these monstrosities, but also developed ways to fight against them. Utilizing the monsters' own reality defying powers they were able to develop techniques to fight back. Creating Faumel objects or allowing themselves to use the very art of magic, they fought back and even contained these beasts. However, that does not overshadow their greatest sin. On the judgment day they were given a decision, one that would decide the fate of Humanity as a whole, and filled with their foolish pride, they made the wrong decision. In the end all the monsters broke free, grouping together and forming greater monsters than the ancient ones could deal with. Then the 10 saviors showed themselves and saved Humanity at the cost of the world.

The objects that the ancient ones left behind are now called wonders and are usually held by kings or beings in faraway places. There is a prophecy that one day a great king will show himself. This king will hold all the wonders in his hand and begin a golden age for Humanity. Recently people have heard rumors that this is actually a prophecy of death and that the great king that all of Humanity is hoping for is nothing but another monster. Time will tell.

# Faith

As said before, humanity has never forgotten about the ancient ones' sin. However they also never forgot about their saviors and some even belief that those saviors still are steadily bringing us closer to salvation.

## The Artificial Lord of Intellect: Alexandra

Alexandra is one of the few saviors who is still rumored to exist. Legend says that with her supreme wisdom and intellect she was able to lead the entirety of the saviors against the monsters. Every decision she made was made within a split second giving all the saviors and upper hand in battle strategy.

It is said within the scripture of Alexandra that she was the only savior made outside conventional means. The Distant Lord had sealed several spirits within an enchanted casing which made an amalgamation of thoughts and humanity. Soon this amalgamation took a substance and form simulating one single sapient creature which became Alexandra.

It is unknown if she truly does still thrive in the new age. Rumors state that she exists in a technologically advanced utopia hidden from human eyes. This Utopia is the same area that the Macros are rumored to hail from.

## The Beast Lord of Creatures: Pathos Crow

Not much is known of Pathos Crow. It is said within his holy scripture that he was the only savior half man and half beast. It details how he spoke to the monsters and infiltrated their ranks.

Pathos Crow is believed to give blessing to all biological creatures, allowing all to live in a beautiful circle of life and death. It is said that he gave blessing to the holy Elliot allowing her to give birth to the first Floric. This Floric was named Alder Elliot and is still their King to this day.

## The Devilish Lord of Necessary Evil: Clef

Clef is the most known savior and serves mostly as an example of the necessary evils we may be encountered with in our daily lives. During the events of the greatest sin, Clef was one of the more prominent and disastrous saviors killing the 13 leaders of the ancient ones and using their bodies to combat the monsters. It was known to all back then and still known now that Clef is to be feared as a man more demon than human.
