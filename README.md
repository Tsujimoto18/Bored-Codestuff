# Tsujimoto's Playground

This is mostly a place where I fuck around with code out of boredom. As a lot of people know I program for entertainment and don't really do much else so this is the place in which I do all that programming.

# SCP Ascension (Garry's Mod)

What if I was able to recreate everything in Ascension and port it to Garry's Mod?
