# Tsujimoto's Playground

This is mostly a place where I fuck around with code out of boredom. As a lot of people know I program for entertainment and don't really do much else so this is the place in which I do all that programming.

# 2D Game Engine

Mostly just a bunch of testing to try and make a 2D game engine from scratch.

# Alteris

An Alternate Intelligence System for use in various programs and systems.

# SCP Ascension (Garry's Mod)

What if I was able to recreate everything in Ascension and port it to Garry's Mod?

# SCP Genesis

A Dungeons and Dragons campaign I am making for some of the discord members.

# Website Practice

This is extremely straight forward.
